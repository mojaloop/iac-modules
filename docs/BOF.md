# Business Operations Framework (BOF) Integration in IaC

The Business Operations Framework (BOF) is utilized for securing backend APIs with authentication and authorization and providing login & logout flows for frontend applications in both mojaloop switch and DFSP (PM4ML) deployments.

## Overview of Business Operations Framework (BOF)

The Business Operations Framework assists Hub Operators / DFSPs in building and deploying business process portals that align with Mojaloop business documentation. It fosters community collaboration in developing a user experience (UX) for Mojaloop Hub Operators / DFSPs, featuring robust APIs, adhering to best practices, and prioritizing security. This aims to bolster adoption and enhance the out-of-the-box value of the Mojaloop solution.


Configuring best practice security involves three levels of control:

1. Access to IAM user interfaces where users are created, suspended, and their roles assigned.
2. Mappings of roles to permissions, which can be edited through a configuration change request.
3. Restrictions on API access based on permissions available to a subject (a user or API client) through their roles.

For more information, refer to the [Mojaloop Hub Operations Framework Documentation](https://mojaloop.github.io/business-operations-framework-docs/).

## Components involved

Here's a breakdown of the components and their respective roles:

| Service                   | Owns                        | Implements                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Keycloak**              | Users                       | 1. User login redirection and UI for token creation<br>2. Standard OIDC authorization code flow |
| **Ory Keto**              | Roles, Participants (Switch deployment) | 1. API RBAC authorization via Ory Oathkeeper<br>2. Backend API call for RBAC authorization |
| **Ory Oathkeeper**        | Permissions related to API access | Decision API for backend APIs with authentication and authorization checks |
| **Ory Kratos**            | User Sessions               | Login and Logout UI flows using cookies |
| **Role-Permission Operator** | -                         | 1. Updates Keto reflecting role-permission assignment changes made in the K8S role custom resource<br>2. Provides na internal API for assigning roles to users |
| **Kubernetes Role Custom Resource** | Roles, Role-Permission assignments | Controlled edits via version control (e.g., GitLab) |
| **Roles Assignment API Service**   | -                      | 1. Role-user API controls<br>2. Participant-user API controls<br>3. Automatic role assignment (`manager` role) to portal_admin users |


## Various Portals Available

### Switch Deployment

- **Finance Portal**
  - https://**finance-portal**.<DOMAIN> (eg: https://finance-portal.example.com)
  - Used by Hub Operators to manage participants, view transfers, perform settlement tasks, and manage user roles.

- **Connection Manager**
  - https://**mcm**.<DOMAIN> (eg: https://mcm.example.com)
  - Used by Hub Operators to onboard participants.

- **Keycloak Admin Console**
  - https://**keycloak**.<DOMAIN> (eg: https://keycloak.example.com)
  - Used by Hub Operators to manage users.


### Payment Manager Deployment

- **PM4ML Portal**
  - https://**portal-<DFSPID>**.<DOMAIN> - (eg: https://portal-DFSP1.example.com)
  - Used by DFSPs to view transfers.

- **Admin Portal**
  - https://**admin-portal-<DFSPID>**.<DOMAIN> (eg: https://admin-portal-DFSP1.example.com)
  - Used by DFSPs to manage user roles. Since there is no finance portal in PM4ML deployment, the admin portal is used to manage the roles of the users.

- **Keycloak Admin Console**
  - https://**keycloak**.<DOMAIN> (eg: https://keycloak.example.com)
  - Used by DFSPs to manage users.


## User Creation

Users can be created via the Keycloak admin console with appropriate privileges.

## Role Assignment

Users with `manager` role can assign roles by logging into the finance portal (Switch deployments) or admin portal (PM4ML deployments). The default `portal_admin` user is provided with `manager` role for initial role assignments. The password for the `portal_admin` user can be seen in Vault.

## Roles and Permissions

New roles or permissions can be created/modified by editing `mojaloop-rbac-permissions.yaml` (Switch deployments) or `pm4ml-rbac-permissions.yaml` (PM4ML deployments). Changes are controlled via version control (e.g., GitLab), the changes to these files are reflected as a new version of the custom resource in the Kubernetes cluster. And the Role-Permission Operator updates Ory Keto accordingly.


## Protecting Backend Endpoints and Enforcing Permissions

Protect backend endpoints by assigning required permissions to roles and users. Ory Oathkeeper enforces these permissions. Configure backend APIs in `mojaloop-rbac-api-resources.yaml` to check user permissions. Changes are managed via version control, and Ory Oathkeeper updates its rules accordingly.


## Example workflows

### Accessing the Finance Portal

1. Operator creates a user in Keycloak admin console.
2. Operator assigns roles to the user by logging into the finance portal with `portal_admin` user (Password can be found in Vault).
3. For example, assign `operator` role for the new user.
4. User logs in to the finance portal (https://**finance-portal**.<DOMAIN>).
5. Finance portal redirects the user to the keycloak login page where the user logs in.
6. Keycloak redirects the user back to the finance portal after successful login.
7. The user is now logged in and can access the finance portal features. (e.g., view transfers, manage participants, etc.)
8. The finance portal uses the stored cookie to access the backend APIs.
9. Ory Oathkeeper checks the permissions of the user and allows/denies access to the backend APIs.

### Accessing the Connection manager portal (MCM)

1. The steps are same for creating a user and assigning roles as in the finance portal.
2. To access the connection manager portal, assign `mcmadmin` role to the user through the finance portal.
3. The user can now access the connection manager portal (https://**mcm**.<DOMAIN>) and perform onboarding tasks.


### Accessing the PM4ML Portal

1. DFSP admin creates a user in Keycloak admin console.
2. DFSP admin assigns roles to the user by logging into the **admin portal** with `portal_admin` user (Password can be found in Vault).
3. For example, assign `pm4mladmin` role for the new user.
4. User logs in to the PM4ML portal (https://**portal-<DFSPID>**.<DOMAIN>) and can access the PM4ML portal features. (e.g., view transfers, etc.)
