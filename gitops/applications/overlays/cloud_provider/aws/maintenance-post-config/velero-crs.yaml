    # You can specify the AWS S3 URL here for explicitness, but Velero can already generate it from

    # Specify an AWS KMS key ID (formatted per the example) or alias (formatted as "alias/<KMS-key-alias-name>"), or its full ARN
    # to enable encryption of the backups stored in S3. Only works with AWS S3 and may require explicitly

    # Set this to "true" if you want to load the credentials file as a [shared config file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-format.html).

    # The Supported values are  "CRC32",  "CRC32C", "SHA1", "SHA256".
